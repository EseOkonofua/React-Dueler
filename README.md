# The Game
Dueler is my RPG/Fantasy take on the very popular game, RockPaperScissors. It includes 7 battles against different enemies with unique ais and awesome names. Players are tasked with defeating these enemies by deciphering the hints sprinkled in their descriptions or by pure pattern recognition. It also features a level unlock system, which gives the game a sense of progression.

# The Technology
I wanted to use _React_ and _Redux_ to create a seamless app like experience. 
* _React-Router_ parameters are used to define the current state of the game and the application.
* I use _React-Router_ combined with _React-Motion_ for seamless route transitions. 
* I use _Redux_ to handle the state of the current game in progress and all the application settings. 
* _HTML5 local storage_ is used to store progress throughout the game. 
* _CSS(SCSS)_ is used for all the in game animations.

# The assets
The images I used for the enemies are all from the free and awesome website [Game-icons.net](http://game-icons.net/) and the music I used was freely distributed online by the creator.
