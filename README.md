# The Game
Dueler is my RPG/Fantasy take on the very popular game, RockPaperScissorse. It includes 7 battles against different enemies with unique ais and awesome names. It also features a level unlock system, which gives the game a sense of progression.

# The Technology
I wanted to use _React_ and _Redux_ to create a seamless app like experience. I used _React-Router_ combined with _React-Motion_ for seamless route transitions. I used Redux to handle the state of the current game in progress and all the application settings. I used _HTML5 local storage_ to store progress throughout the game. 
I used _CSS(SCSS)_ for all the in game animations.

# The assets
The images I used for the enemies are all from the free and awesome website [Game-icons.net](http://game-icons.net/) and the music I used was freely distributed but created by _.
