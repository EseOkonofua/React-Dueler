Dueler is a game I decided to make. I wanted to use React and Redux to create an app like experience.
The game is a rock paper scissors type game with a Dueling/Warrior theme.


The player will face 7 unique battles, each enemy having different behavior based on what has transpired in battle. 

Technologies used are React, Redux, React-Motion, SCSS, Express.
Uses HTML5 LocalStorage to keep track of Locked/Unlocked levels.
